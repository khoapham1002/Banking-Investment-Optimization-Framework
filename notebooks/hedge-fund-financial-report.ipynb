    "# Hedge Fund Financial Report\n",
    "Analyzed leverage and profitability ratios across industries to provide data-driven insights for hedge fund investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two datasets:    \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Balance_Sheet.xlsx`: Contains financial information related to assets, liabilities, and equity.  \n",
    "- `Income_Statement.xlsx`: Contains revenue, expenses, and profitability metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these datasets have three columns in common:   \n",
    "- `\"Company\"`: The company's ticker name.\n",
    "- `\"comp_type\"` The type of industry the company in question belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - `\"tech\"` for companies in the technology industry\n",
    "    - `\"fmcg\"` for companies in the fast-moving consumer goods industry\n",
    "    - `\"real_est\"` for companies in the real estate industry. \n",
    "- `\"Year\"`: The year the company's information is from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the columns in the datasets contain information from the financial statement of the `\"Company\"` in question. Note that the columns in `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` only contain financial information from the balance sheet. Similarly, the columns in `Income_Statement.xlsx` only contain financial information from the income statement. The columns are named accordingly. For instance, the column `\"Total Liab\"` from `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` is the total liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Compute the two ratios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A debt-to-equity ratio or an equity multiplier ratio.    \n",
    "    Save this ratio in a column named `\"leverage_ratio\"` in a DataFrame called `df_ratios`.\n",
    "* A gross margin ratio or an operating margin ratio.    \n",
    "    Save this ratio in a column named `\"profitability_ratio\"`, in a DataFrame called `df_ratios`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets have information on the type of industry a company belongs to in a column called comp_type. Your manager also needs you to answer these three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which company type (comp_type) has the lowest profitability ratio?    \n",
    "    Save this comp_type value as a string in a variable called lowest_profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which company type has the highest leverage ratio?    \n",
    "    Save this comp_type value as a string in a variable called highest_leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the relationship between leverage and profitability in the real estate companies represented in this data?    \n",
    "    Is it \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or \"no relationship?\" Save one of these three strings in a variable called relationship."
