### Credit Card Approvals

Objective: Automate the credit card approval process using supervised learning.

Key Tasks:
- Preprocessed raw data by replacing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Trained a logistic regression model to classify applications as approved or rejected.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Key Insights:
- Achieved an accuracy of 79.8%, improving the efficiency of the credit card approval process.
- Provided a scalable pipeline for automating application decisions.

### Bank Marketing Campaign

Objective: Enhanced marketing strategies for a bankâ€™s personal loan campaigns by analyzing customer demographics and campaign outcomes.

Key Tasks:
- Processed raw data into three structured DataFrames: client, campaign, and economics, each designed for specific analytical purposes.
- Reformatted data to meet PostgreSQL database standards, enabling seamless integration and scalability.

Key Insights:
- Created clean, consistent datasets for future analysis of campaign success rates.
- Enabled better tracking of customer behavior and campaign performance.

### Hedge Fund Financial Report

Objective: Assess financial health and risk metrics across industries.

Key Tasks:
- Calculated leverage ratios (debt-to-equity) and profitability ratios (gross margin) for companies in tech, FMCG, and real estate sectors.
- Analyzed sector trends, identifying real estate as having the highest leverage ratio (5.69) and FMCG as the least profitable sector (profitability ratio: 0.51).
- Visualized the positive correlation between leverage and profitability in real estate companies.

Key Insights:
- Provided industry-specific financial insights to guide investment decisions.
- Enhanced understanding of risk and return dynamics in diverse sectors.

### Stock Portfolio Analysis
Objective: Analyze FAANG stocks to determine optimal portfolio allocations.

Key Tasks:

- Calculate expected returns and annualized Sharpe ratio for an equally-weighted portfolio.
- Find a portfolio that minimizes volatility using mean-variance optimization.
- Find a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio using mean-variance optimization.

Key Insights:
- Achieved a Sharpe ratio of 3.5 in the optimized portfolio, showcasing how diversification reduces risk.
- Highlighted efficient investment strategies based on historical stock performance.
